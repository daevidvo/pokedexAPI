## Description üìù

Track your Pokemon, create relationships between them, and create thoughts for them all in one application. Through the utilization of MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js, this application is able to create, read, update, and delete information between Pokemon and all of the information is stored in a MongoDB backend thanks to the usage of Mongoose.

## Learning Points ‚úçÔ∏è

The benefit of using Mongoose/MongoDB in this application compared to other backend databases like MySQL is that due to the sheer size of Pokemon entries in the National Pokedex (over 1000), if a user was enthusiastic enough to put in all of the existing, and to be created, Pokemon into the database, manipulating data would be much faster compared to MySQL. 

Of course, there's also downsides of using MongoDB as a backend, such as, the lack of strict data validations like there are in MySQL and the relational pairings that data entries can have with one another.
